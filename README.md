KNN Algorithm Implementation
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with four distinct approaches for data analysis. The KNN algorithm is a versatile and intuitive method for classification and regression tasks.

Overview
The KNN algorithm works by classifying a data point based on the 'k' nearest data points in a feature space. This project explores various enhancements to the traditional KNN approach to improve classification accuracy and robustness.

Steps
Step 1: Basic KNN
In the first step, the algorithm applies the standard KNN approach to a large dataset. This serves as a baseline for comparison with the subsequent steps.

Step 2: Weighted KNN
The second approach involves assigning weights to the data points based on certain criteria. This weight assignment aims to give more significance to certain data points, thereby potentially improving the algorithm's performance.

Step 3: Feature Correlation Weighting
In this step, the algorithm assigns weights to features based on their correlation with the target variable. Features with higher correlation receive higher weights, influencing the classification process accordingly.

Step 4: Correlation-Based Feature Weighting
Finally, the algorithm incorporates feature-level weighting based on the correlation between features. Features with low correlation to other features receive less weight, potentially reducing noise and improving classification accuracy.

Usage
To use this implementation of the KNN algorithm, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (list them if any).
Run the main script or notebook to see the implementation in action.
Experiment with different parameters and datasets to evaluate performance.
